# Virtual Try-On Project Roadmap

## Project Overview

Create a "Virtual Try-On" system with two main functionalities:

1. **Static Image Try-On**: Take a clothing image and a person's image, then superimpose the clothing onto the person
2. **Realtime Webcam Try-On**: Apply selected clothing items to a person in real-time using webcam input

## Phase 1: Research and Planning (2-4 weeks)

- **Literature Review**: Study existing virtual try-on papers and implementations
  - Key papers: VITON, CP-VTON, ClothFlow
  - Open-source implementations to consider
- **Data Collection**: Identify datasets for training/testing
  - MPV, DeepFashion, VITON dataset
- **Technology Stack Selection**:
  - Python
  - OpenCV for image processing
  - PyTorch/TensorFlow for deep learning
  - Flask/Django for potential web interface
  - ONNX for model optimization

## Phase 2: Static Image Try-On Development (6-8 weeks)

### Module 1: Person Parsing (2 weeks)

- Implement human pose estimation (OpenPose or MMPose)
- Develop clothing-agnostic person representation
- Body segmentation (U-Net or similar architecture)

### Module 2: Clothing Processing (2 weeks)

- Clothing segmentation (Mask R-CNN or U-Net)
- Feature extraction from clothing items
- Warping clothing to match body pose

### Module 3: Try-On Synthesis (3 weeks)

- Implement GAN-based try-on (e.g., VITON architecture)
- Develop blending techniques for realistic results
- Post-processing for realism (Poisson blending, shadow generation)

### Module 4: User Interface (1 week)

- Simple GUI for image input/output
- Basic image editing capabilities

## Phase 3: Realtime Webcam Try-On (4-6 weeks)

### Module 1: Realtime Pose Estimation (2 weeks)

- Implement lightweight pose estimation (MoveNet, BlazePose)
- Optimize for realtime performance (30+ FPS)

### Module 2: Clothing Application Pipeline (2 weeks)

- Develop frame-by-frame clothing warping
- Implement temporal consistency techniques
- Optimize for realtime performance

### Module 3: Webcam Interface (1-2 weeks)

- OpenCV-based webcam interface
- Clothing selection menu
- Try-on adjustment controls

## Phase 4: Integration and Optimization (3-4 weeks)

- Combine static and realtime pipelines
- Performance optimization (model quantization, ONNX conversion)
- Memory management for multiple clothing items
- Quality improvement iterations

## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment (2-3 weeks)

- Unit testing for individual components
- End-to-end testing with diverse body types/clothing
- Performance benchmarking
- Deployment options:
  - Desktop application (PyQt/PySide)
  - Web application (Flask + JavaScript)
  - Mobile consideration (TensorFlow Lite)

## Phase 6: Advanced Features (Optional)

- Multi-clothing layering
- Texture/pattern modification
- Virtual fitting room with AR (using ARCore/ARKit)
- Size recommendation system
- Social sharing features

## Technology Stack

- **Core**: Python 3.8+
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV, PIL
- **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Pose Estimation**: OpenPose, MediaPipe
- **Web Framework**: Flask/FastAPI (if web version)
- **GUI**: PyQt/Tkinter or OpenCV built-in
- **Optimization**: ONNX Runtime, TensorRT

## Milestones

1. M1: Basic person parsing working (Week 4)
2. M2: Static try-on prototype (Week 10)
